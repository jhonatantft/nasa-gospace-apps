Go Space Project - Nasa Space Apps Challenge
=======================

**Live Demo**: https://gospace.club/

Through a platform of knowledge, we develop a designed project for the young generation by data science provide by NASA and we provide the connection between science and the public. This platform has an interface that fits the target audience, is interactive, and is connected with the NASA directory database. The benefit of this project is that brings knowledge to various communities and shares the content in a soft way around the world, powered by NASA social media and reaching the public by their age range.

**Note:** There is no preference how you name or structure your views.
You could place all your templates in a top-level `views` directory without
having a nested folder structure, if that makes things easier for you.
Just don't forget to update `extends ../layout`  and corresponding
`res.render()` paths in controllers.

Docker
----------

You will need docker and docker-compose installed to build the application.

- [Docker installation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)

- [Common problems setting up docker](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/faqs/troubleshoot/)

After installing docker, start the application with the following commands :

```
# To build the project for the first time or when you add dependencies
docker-compose build web

# To start the application (or to restart after making changes to the source code)
docker-compose up web

```

To view the app, find your docker IP address + port 8080 ( this will typically be http://localhost:8080/ ).  To use a port other than 8080, you would need to modify the port in app.js, Dockerfile, and docker-compose.yml.


Deployment
----------

Once you are ready to deploy your app, you will need to create an account with a cloud platform to host it. These are not the only choices, but they are my top picks. From my experience, the easiest way to get started is with **Heroku**. It will automatically restart your Node.js process when it crashes, has zero-downtime deployments and supports custom domains on free accounts. Additionally, you can
create an account with **MongoDB Atlas** and then pick one of the *4* providers below.
Again, there are plenty of other choices, and you are not limited to just the ones
listed below.

### Deployment with Heroku

- Download and install [Heroku Toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/)
- In a terminal, run `heroku login` and enter your Heroku credentials
- From *your app* directory run `heroku create`
- Run `heroku addons:create mongolab`.  This will set up the mLab add-on and configure the `MONGODB_URI` environment variable in your Heroku app for you.
- Lastly, do `git push heroku master`.  Done!

**Note:** To install Heroku add-ons your account must be verified.

### Hosted MongoDB Atlas

<img src="https://www.mongodb.com/assets/images/global/MongoDB_Logo_Dark.svg" width="200">

- Go to [https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas)
- Click the green **Get started free** button
- Fill in your information then hit **Get started free**
- You will be redirected to Create New Cluster page.
- Select a **Cloud Provider and Region** (such as AWS and a free tier region)
- Select cluster Tier to **Free Shared Clusters**
- Give Cluster a name (default: Cluster0)
- Click on green **:zap:Create Cluster button**
- Now, to access your database you need to create a DB user. To create a new MongoDB user, from the **Clusters view**, select the **Security tab**
- Under the **MongoDB Users** tab, click on **+Add New User**
- Fill in a username and password and give it either **Atlas Admin** User Privilege
- Next, you will need to create an IP address whitelist and obtain the connection URI.  In the Clusters view, under the cluster details (i.e. SANDBOX - Cluster0), click on the **CONNECT** button.
- Under section **(1) Check the IP Whitelist**, click on **ALLOW ACCESS FROM ANYWHERE**. The form will add a field with `0.0.0.0/0`.  Click **SAVE** to save the `0.0.0.0/0` whitelist.
- Under section **(2) Choose a connection method**, click on **Connect Your Application**
- In the new screen, select **Node.js** as Driver and version **2.2.12 or later**. _*WARNING*_: Do not pick 3.0 or later since connect-mongo can't handle mongodb+srv:// connection strings.
- Finally, copy the URI connection string and replace the URI in MONGODB_URI of `.env.example` with this URI string.  Make sure to replace the <PASSWORD> with the db User password that you created under the Security tab.
- Note that after some of the steps in the Atlas UI, you may see a banner stating `We are deploying your changes`.  You will need to wait for the deployment to finish before using the DB in your application.


**Note:** As an alternative to MongoDB Atlas, there is also [Compose](https://www.compose.io/).
